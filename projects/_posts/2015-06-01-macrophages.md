To fight infection, maintain tissue homeostasis, and heal injuries, the cells of the human immune system perform a staggeringly complex spectrum of molecular tasks. Recent studies of differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and dendritic cells have questioned the sharpness of the boundaries between these cell types. The Trapnell laboratory is using macrophages as a model system for investigating cellular specialization. We aim to unveil the molecular regulation of macrophage specialization by using single-cell genomics to survey macrophages from different tissues and polarizing (or repolarizing) them into different states.  

## Polarization and repolarization in host defense

Upon phagocytosis and presentation of foreign peptides to T cells, macrophages are activated and “polarize” into an transcriptional program that helps clear infection. Recent studies have dramatically expanded the range of known functions performed by highly specialized macrophage subsets.  Macrophages can be polarized into the “M1” state, which amplifies local tissue inflammation, as well as several others including an “M2” state, which plays an important role in reducing inflammation and promoting healing. The functional diversity of macrophages has challenged the classical view of the monocyte-derived hierarchy and questioned the very definition of cell differentiation. However, whether the M1 cells are directly “repolarized” to M2 rather than cleared to make way for M2 cells is unknown. Furthermore, M2 macrophages have recently been classified into several subtypes, with overlapping but distinct cytokine profiles and functional roles. Do individual macrophages fall into discrete, stable subtypes? Or might they occupy a large continuous “landscape” of epigenetic, transcriptional, and functional states? What signals, receptors, kinases, and transcription factors determine macrophage state?

## Tissue macrophage specialization

Macrophages are involved in the homeostasis, defense, and repair of nearly every tissue in the body and perform myriad tissue-specific functions. How is regulation of “general” duties of macrophages integrated and balanced with tissue-specific tasks? For example, alveolar macrophages process and clear lipid phagocytosed as part of normal tissue maintenance, primarily through PPARg. These cells must also defend the lung against inhaled pathogens. PPARg is a known inhibitor of pro-inflammatory gene expression programming, suggesting it plays a role in establishing the “M2” state. Thus, alveolar and adipose-resident macrophages would seem to need perform two opposing tasks simultaneously. Are there two specialized subpopulations in lung, that coexist? Or is there a mechanism by which a single population can switch between these roles? Does this mechanism require clearance and replacement with fresh monocyte-derived cells? Or might these polarization stages be fully reversible in situ? We are working to understand how macrophages interpret cues from their tissue microenvironment to adopt specialized roles and while maintaining host defense tasks.
