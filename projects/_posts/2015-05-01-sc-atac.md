description: Chromatin accessibility measurements in single-cells

[ATAC-Seq](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n12/full/nmeth.2688.html) is an assay for interrogating the entire genome for accessibility to DNA binding proteins in a single experiment. In collaboration with [Jay Shendure's lab](http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/) and scientists at [Illumina](http://www.illumina.com/), we recently adapted this method for use in single cells. Our initial study, led by [Darren Cusanovich](http://faculty.washington.edu/cusanovi/index.html), explored variation in chromatin accessibility both between and within populations of single cells. Our single-cell ATAC-Seq relies on combinatorial cellular indexing, and thus does not require the physical isolation of individual cells during library construction.  The technique scales sublinearly in time and cost and can profile thousands of individual cells in a single experiment.
