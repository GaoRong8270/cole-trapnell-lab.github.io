I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Genome Sciences](http://www.gs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington.  I study cell differentiation, reprogramming and cell-cell communication. I also develop technologies to help identify genes that regulate these processes.  I'm particularly interested in mesenchymal stem cells, which are now used to treat a number of diseases. These cells have great potential, but are still poorly understood. They are multipotent; they can generate precursor cells of bone, fat, and cartilage, and might be capable of making other cell types as well.  What genes control a mesenchymal stem cell's choices about which of these cell types to become? Can we manipulate them to treat disease or injury? Mesenchymal stem cells are also capable of interacting with and changing the behavior of the immune system.  Which immune cells do mesenchymal stem cells talk to, and how do they change the immune system's response to infection, injury, and organ transplants?  Could we harness harness mesenchymal stem cells to help fight infection, improve recovery after injury, or improve the chances that an organ transplant will be accepted by the patient's immune system?

I received my bachelor's degree and my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Maryland. As a graduate student, I was co-advised by [Steven Salzberg](http://ccb.jhu.edu/people/salzberg/Salzberg/Salzberg_Lab_Home.html), and [Lior Pachter](http://math.berkeley.edu/~lpachter/) from the University of California, Berkeley, where I was a visiting student for several years. While working with Steven and Lior, I wrote TopHat and Cufflinks, and I helped Ben Langmead with Bowtie. I trained as postdoc in [John Rinn](http://www.rinnlab.com/)'s lab at Harvard's Department of [Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology](http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/), where I learned to work with stem cells.  Near the end of my time at Harvard, I worked with Davide Cacchiarelli on Monocle.
