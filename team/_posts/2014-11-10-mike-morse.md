I'm the Lab Manager for the Trapnell lab.  I received my B.Sc. in Chemistry with a concentration in Biochemistry from Bridgewater State University. Before joining Cole's lab in Seattle, I worked with closely with Cole and several other postdocs in John Rinn's lab at Harvard. In John's lab, I studied the role of long noncoding RNAs in development and cancer. There, I mastered advanced molecular biology techniques such as RNA-Seq and single-molecule RNA FISH.
