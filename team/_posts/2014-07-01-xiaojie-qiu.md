It becomes a trend in life science community to study biological phenomena from first principles. Development has long been regarded as one of the most mysterious problems in biology. In the past years I work with people with background in physics and mathematics to understand the general mechanisms in development, reprogramming, transdifferentiation as well as other cellular fate conversions. Those projects are closely correlated with the mathematical quantification of the famous embryologist Conrad Waddington’s "epigenetic landscape”.  As the advent of single-cell RNA-seq, it becomes an exciting era for us to quantify the dynamics, reconstruct the trajectory and even map landscape during lineage fate switching. All those require us to establish sophisticate statistical model powerful mathematical tools to decipher the enormous data generated from single-cell sequencing.

As pointed out by Dobzhansky that "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution", the development cannot also be really understood without referring to evolution. How does the development reshape through evolution? Why and how is the evolution constrained by the development (related to Stephen Jay Gould's Spandrels). To understand the developmental mechanisms will be the first steps towards those fundamental questions.
