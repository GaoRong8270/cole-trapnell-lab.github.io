I am a Genome Sciences grad student joint-advised by Cole and [Jay Shendure](http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/shendure.htm). I received a B.S. in Biology from Georgetown University. Before starting graduate school, I worked for Dr. [Bryan Traynor](https://www.irp.nia.nih.gov/branches/lng/ndrg.htm) in the [Laboratory of Neurogenetics](http://www.irp.nia.nih.gov/branches/lng/lngindex.htm) at the NIH where I worked to investigate the genetic etiology of neuromuscular diseases. In the Trapnell Lab, I am investigating chromatin accessibility by analyzing single cell ATAC-seq data.
