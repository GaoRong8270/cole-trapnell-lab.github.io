An MD-PhD graduate and board-certified pediatrician from Switzerland, I am a member of the pediatric hematology/oncology [fellowship program](http://pedsfellowship.fhcrc.org) in Seattle. 

I am interested in how cell fate is regulated, both in normal physiology as well as in different disease states. I previously worked in the fields of telomere biology ([Claus Azzalin](http://www.bc.biol.ethz.ch/research/azzalin.html), ETH ZÃ¼rich) and hematopoietic stem cells ([Andreas Trumpp](http://www.dkfz.de/en/stammzellen-und-krebs), EPF Lausanne, now at DKFZ Heidelberg). My current research focuses on the application of single-cell genomics and computational biology to a variety of cellular transitions (with a particular focus on B-cell development), aiming at reconstructing trajectories of single cells and identifying key regulators of cellular fate decisions.

I spend most of my free time exploring the beautiful Pacific Northwest with my lovely family.
