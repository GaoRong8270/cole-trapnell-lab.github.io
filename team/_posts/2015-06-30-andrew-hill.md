I am a graduate student in Genome Sciences jointly advised by [Jay Shendure](http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/) and Cole Trapnell. Most of my ongoing work revolves around using single-cell technologies to enable novel genetic screens and conduct organism-scale profiling of transcription and chromatin accessibility.

Prior to graduate school I completed a Bachelors in Bioengineering and worked on novel improvements to robotic surgery in Blake Hannaford and Howard Chizeck's Biorobotics Lab at UW. After graduating, I took an interest in genomics and worked in [Daniel MacArthur](https://macarthurlab.org/)'s group at Massachusetts General Hospital / Broad Institute. Early in graduate school I was also a computational biology intern and software consultant for 10X Genomics.
